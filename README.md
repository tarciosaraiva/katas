Katas
=====

Motivated by the simple fact that I want to be a better dev, I searched for a way that I could enhance my skills whilst revisiting some concepts that are being made popular again - such as recursion.

Came across this [this website](http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/index.pl?KataCatalogue) with exercises that will span many abilities.

My hope is that I can implement them in languages I don't know and languages I'm comfortable with. Some examples of implementations I have in mind:

* Ruby
* Javascript
* Java
* Scala
* Clojure

Hope it benefits you in one way or another.
